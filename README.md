   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hookah-rental-bot.git
   cd hookah-rental-bot
2. Install dependencies: go mod download
3. Create a Telegram bot and obtain an API token.
4. Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file and add your Telegram API token:

5. Database Setup
Make sure that you have an SQLite database file named hookah_bot.db in the project directory with the following structure:

Language Selection: When a user starts the bot, they choose a language.
Order Process: The bot collects the userâ€™s name, address, phone number, and preferred delivery time.
Tobacco Selection: Users can select one or more tobacco flavors.
Order Confirmation: The user is asked to confirm their order. If any details are incorrect, they can update them.
Admin Notification: Once the user confirms the order, the admin receives the details.
Database Storage: If the user is placing an order for the first time, their information is stored in the SQLite database.
